# About the project:<br>
This is a local documentation search engine based on official documentation releases of multiple linux projects. <br><br>
The idea is to make a local offline copy of all available documentation and after use grep to search for what you are looking for. Some sort of "offline documentation search engine running on CLI".<br><br>
The tongue-update.sh script will take care of downloading the pages for you while tongue.sh will prompt you with what is needed to perform the search you want. Note that the search is performed through html and pdf files<br>
<br>
# Installation and usage:<br>
1 - Download the tongue-update.sh and tongue.sh scripts<br>
2 - Set execution permissions to both scripts: ```sudo chmod a+x tongue-update.sh ; sudo chmod a+x tongue.sh```<br>
You will also have to set your username for "GERRITUSER" variable on tongue-update script. Its also necessary to change variable "CALIBREPATH" on tongue script, pointing to a place in your machine where you keep pdf files<br>
3 - Copy the scripts to /usr/bin with: ```sudo cp tongue-update.sh /usr/bin/tongue-update ; sudo cp tongue.sh /usr/bin/tongue```<br>
4 - By default, these files are saved in "$HOME/Downloads/tongue". You can change that also by editing the variable "DOCUMENTPATH" on tongue-update script. Once you have all set, run ``` tongue-update ``` command to download the documentation. <br>
5 - After the download is done, run tongue to start searching. Run ```tongue -h``` for a list of options<br>
6 - A list of html files will be displayed with the terms you searched for. These are paged with "less" command. Do Ctrl+Click on the links to open them in your webrowser. Once you find what you need, open the page you downloaded with your browser (i suggest using w3m if you want to open that from the terminal<br>
7 - Enjoy<br>
